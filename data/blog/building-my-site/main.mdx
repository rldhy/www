## Introduction: A Fun Journey Into My Online Presence

After putting it off for way too long, I finally launched my personal website â€” [rlodhiya.dev](https://rlodhiya.dev)!

This project was equal parts fun and functional. I wanted a space that not only reflects who I am as a person and a software engineer, but also gives me a platform to share my projects, ideas, and maybe the occasional rant or two. More than anything, I wanted to build something just for myselfâ€”something minimal, fast, and authentically me.

## Why I Built This

The motivation was simple:
- [Funzies](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=funzies&defid=2459265)
- Helps me grow my online presence
- Showcase my skills
- Share my work, hobbies, etc
- Offer my expertise and services to those in need

Whether someone stumbles on my rÃ©sumÃ©, GitHub, or LinkedIn, this site is now a hub that ties it all together.

## Tech Stack

I built the site using:
- Next.js â€“ for its speed, flexibility, and SSR goodness
- Tailwind CSS â€“ for clean, utility-first styling that doesn't slow me down
- TypeScript â€“ because why not?

Itâ€™s intentionally lightweight and minimalâ€”focused more on clarity and function than flash.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

Right now, the site includes:
- A short bio (hi, Iâ€™m Ritwik ðŸ‘‹)
- A rÃ©sumÃ© page (WIP)
- Links to my socials and projects
- A blog (this is the first post!)

The blog will be a mix of dev write-ups, thoughts on tech, project breakdowns, and anything else I find interesting enough to share.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

More content!

Iâ€™ll be updating the blog as I goâ€”sharing behind-the-scenes notes on projects, things Iâ€™m learning, and ideas I want to explore publicly. Iâ€™m excited to keep improving the site as my work (and interests) evolve.
