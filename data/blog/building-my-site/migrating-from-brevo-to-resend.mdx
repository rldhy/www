I originally used [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com) (formerly Sendinblue) to handle contact form submissions on my site, and it worked fine. But [Resend](https://resend.com) offers a much simpler developer experience — built for frameworks like Next.js and Vercel.

Here’s how I made the switch.

## 📦 Installing Resend

```bash
npm install resend
```

## 🛠️ Brevo: What I Had Before

```ts
import { TransactionalEmailsApi, SendSmtpEmail } from '@getbrevo/brevo'

const api = new TransactionalEmailsApi()
api.setApiKey('apiKey', process.env.BREVO_API_KEY!)

await api.sendTransacEmail(new SendSmtpEmail({
  to: [{ email: 'hello@rlodhiya.dev' }],
  sender: { email: 'system@rlodhiya.dev', name: 'RL-System' },
  subject: 'Contact Form',
  htmlContent: '<p>Message</p>',
}))
```

## 🔁 Replaced with Resend

```ts
import { Resend } from 'resend'

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)

await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'RL-System <system@rlodhiya.dev>',
  to: ['hello@rlodhiya.dev'],
  subject: 'Contact Form',
  html: '<p>Message</p>',
})
```

## 📬 Reusable HTML Builder

```ts
// message-builder.ts
export function buildGetInTouchHtml({ fullName, message }: GetInTouchArgs) {
  return `<div><p><strong>${fullName}</strong>: ${message}</p></div>`
}
```

Both Brevo and Resend now use this for consistency.

## 🧠 Generic EmailService Wrapper

I created a service that reads from `EMAIL_PROVIDER` in `.env` and routes the request to the correct implementation.

```ts
const service = new EmailService()
await service.sendGetInTouchMessage(args)
```

## ✅ Why I Switched

Resend feels tailor-made for modern React and serverless projects. Type-safe, clean, and no extra ceremony. It also plays nicely with my Vercel deployment.

No regrets!
