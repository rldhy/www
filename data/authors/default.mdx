# Introduction

I am a software engineer, and tech lead that has been immersed in the ever-evolving world of technology. With ~12 years of dynamic experience, I remain curious, humble, and committed to continuous learning and growth. I am passionate about technology and strongly believe in its potential to improve the overall human living experience. I am analytical and strongly believe in data driven decision-making. I thrive in innovative, mission driven environments, and I care deeply about growing every team member. I advocate for engineering excellence and create resilient, secure, and scalable systems that are user-friendly, as well as easy to read and maintain.

I specialize in back-end development, with expertise in several key software engineering skills, including microservices architecture, systems design, APIs (REST, gRPC, GraphQL), distributed systems, test-driven development, domain-driven design, database development, and cloud technologies on AWS + GCP. Furthermore, I have extensive expertise and experience in establishing automated pipelines for continuous integration/delivery (CI / CD), containerization and orchestration using technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, and creating / managing resources using infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform. I am highly proficient in full stack development, and am enthusiastically growing my skills + expertise in machine learning and AI. I pay close attention to metrics and observability, ensuring that every aspect of the software development process is measured and optimized for maximum impact.

Throughout my career, I have led multi-team efforts and collaborated with leaders, product teams, data science + data engineering experts, and business/domain specialists. This broad interaction has not only polished my technical prowess but has also equipped me with a holistic understanding of the software development lifecycle. I've taken on roles ranging from mentoring, recruitment, project planning, and prioritization. I've owned critical domain areas in platform services, taken software projects from zero to launch, built robust APIs, and provided technical leadership and direction.

Beyond my professional life, I am a liver of life and a lover of culture and the great outdoors.
