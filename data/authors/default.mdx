## Introduction

Hi, I’m Ritwik — a software engineer who loves building things.

I created this site to share the work I’m proud of, explore new ideas, and connect with people who might want to collaborate. Whether it’s solving a real problem or just tinkering for fun, I enjoy bringing ideas to life with clean, thoughtful code and architecture. To learn more about my professional accomplishments, please see my [résumé](/resume).

Most of the projects here were built in my free time and reflect the kind of work I enjoy doing: intuitive, interactive, and purpose-driven.

Outside of work, I’m always exploring new tools, frameworks, and design patterns. I'm especially drawn to the overlap between developer experience and user experience — building products that feel good to use and easy to maintain.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to [reach out](/contact) if something here resonates with you.
