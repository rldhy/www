# Introduction

With over 11 years of dynamic experience as a software engineer, I am deeply immersed in the ever-evolving world of technology. From my early days in university, where I discovered my passion for computer science, to the present, my commitment to continuous learning and growth has been unwavering.

I specialize in backend development with some experience in full-stack development. Proficient in programming languages such as Python, Go, Typescript, Javascript, Java, C#, and databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, T-SQL, I advocate for engineering excellence and create systems that are both readable and scalable. My expertise extends to key software engineering skills, including microservices architecture, systems design, API design, distributed systems, test-driven development, domain-driven design, among others. From writing code locally to establishing automated pipelines for continuous integration/delivery, I have a diverse skill set. Additionally, I am immersing myself in the realms of Machine Learning and AI, driven by a passion to apply cutting-edge solutions to real-world challenges.

In the technology landscape, I am comfortable navigating cloud environments, proficient in AWS and GCP. My skills also encompass Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, allowing me to orchestrate and manage scalable, containerized applications efficiently.

Highly numbers-oriented, I firmly believe in making data-driven decisions. I pay close attention to metrics and observability, ensuring that every aspect of the software development process is measured and optimized for maximum impact.

Throughout my career, I have led multi-team efforts and collaborated with leaders, product teams, data science experts, and business/domain specialists. This broad interaction has not only polished my technical prowess but has also equipped me with a holistic understanding of the software development lifecycle. I've taken on roles ranging from mentoring interns and new hires to actively participating in recruitment, project planning, and prioritization. I've owned critical domain areas with multiple services and contributed meaningfully to UX design, user workflows, and software architecture.

As I chart new territories in Machine Learning and AI, my aim is not only to apply these transformative technologies in a meaningful, impactful way but also to emerge as a leader in the tech space. I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to merge my seasoned expertise with my passion for engineering excellence, leadership, and ongoing learning.With over 11 years of dynamic experience as a software engineer, I am deeply immersed in the ever-evolving world of technology.
